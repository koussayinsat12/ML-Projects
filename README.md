# ML-Projects

A collection of my early **Machine Learning** practice projects, exploring different datasets and models.  
Each project is implemented in a **Jupyter Notebook** and demonstrates key ML concepts like **data preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, **model training**, and **evaluation**.
